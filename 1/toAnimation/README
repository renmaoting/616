This directory is intended as a gradual introduction to animation
using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).

The usual progression for viewing the files in the directories should be:
  (1) blit -- just a simple demo of blitting
  (2) drawOn -- blitting a sprite onto another sprite
  (3) cpuAnim -- an animation that uses the cpu clock rather than
      the SDL game clock.
  (4) gameClockAnim -- this animation uses the distance formula, 
      and the SDL game clock to generate a smooth animation that
      runs the same on all platforms and computers.
  (5) smoothAnim -- this one's the best

To make a video from a list of frames:
