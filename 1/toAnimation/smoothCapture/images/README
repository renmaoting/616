This directory will contain the frames generated to make a video.
You should test your frame generation to make sure that it works,
but do not submit a project with the frames generated because
the aggregation  of submissions will be too large.

Therefore, include in your Makefile a facility to clean this
directory, and make sure you "make clean" before you submit.
