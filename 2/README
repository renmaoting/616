Project description: 
1. I print my name and the title of my animation in the lower left corner of the screen.
2. Put the global constants WORLD WIDTH and WORLD HEIGHT into xml file game.xml
3. Convert GoF's singleton to the Meyerâ€™s singleton
4. Write an overloaded assignment operator for class Sprite
5. Incorporate parallax scrolling into the animation by using at least two backgrounds.
6. Extend the Clock class so that the animation can be paused with the p key.
7. Convert printMessageValueAt to use the Inclusion Model to manage instantiation.
8. Convert the current tracker framework into a meaningful animation
9. I created a TwoWayMultiSprite class and Hero class. For TwoWayMultiSprite, it can travel in two direction.
   And for Hero class, it can explode and be add a special effect, you can see it in my game. So I add three
   types of sprites in the vector. When you press T key, you can switch the sprite you tracked. And when you 
   press E, if you are tracking a Hero instance, it will be explode. 

10. I have checked, there are no memory leak.

My contribution: all
